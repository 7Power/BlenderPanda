Getting Started
===============

The first step to using BlenderPanda is to make sure you have it :doc:`properly installed <install>`.

Previewing
----------
BlenderPanda is implemented as a Render Engine, so make sure it is selected from the Render Engine dropdown in Blender's info bar.
To preview a scene in Panda3D, simply switch to a rendered viewport.
Depending on the size of the Blender scene, it may take some time to convert to Panda3D.

Starting a Project
------------------
This section aims to discuss just enough about managing a project to get you going with BlenderPanda.
You can find more information on managing a project in BlenderPanda in the :doc:`Project Mangement section <project_management>`.
